# SongMaster
##  Song quiz game powered by Spotify API
Login with your Spotify account and select one of your playlists to play a quiz game. There are 3 game modes: guess song title, guess artist, and mixed.
## Requirements
* Node.js and npm installed (or docker installed)
* Spotify Premium subscription

## Deployment
### Clone repository and install dependencies
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/narancs93/SongMaster
$ cd SongMaster
$ npm install
```
### Setup environment
For this step you need to have an App created in [Spotify Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard). From there you can get the Client ID and Client secret for authentication. You will also need to configure a Redirect URI, so the Spotify authentication service automatically invokes your app every time a user logs in. These steps are described in the [Spotify Web API Documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/app-settings/).

Once you have the Client ID, Client Secret and Redirect URI:
* Create a ```.env``` file inside SongMaster directory with the following contents:

```sh
HTTP_PORT=http_port_to_listen_on
CLIENT_ID='your_client_id_here'
CLIENT_SECRET='your_client_secret_here'
REDIRECT_URI='your_redirect_uri_here'
```
Replace the value of CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET and REDIRECT_URI variables with the values you have from your Spotify Dashboard. (The app will start listening on the port specified in the HTTP_PORT variable, so that port has to match the port in the Redirect URI.)

Example with random values:
```sh
HTTP_PORT=8080
CLIENT_ID='pc39vei3kym3ac2b2fhu47xu6xgmvb9p'
CLIENT_SECRET='iaudnq29njacx6bmmx25pt84p9gddewj'
REDIRECT_URI='http://10.11.12.13:8080/callback'
```

Start the app.

```sh
node src/app.js
```


## Configure HTTPS

To configure HTTPS
* Add the following values to the ```.env``` file.

```sh
HTTPS_PORT=443
certPath='/path/to/certificate.crt'
keyPath='/path/to/private/key.key'
```

To generate a self-signed certificate

```sh
openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -x509 -sha256 -days 365 -nodes -out yourdomain.crt -keyout yourdomain.key
```

## Deploy with docker

```.env``` file has to be created and filled as mentioned above in Setup environment section.

Build image and tag it

```sh
docker build . -t <your username>/song-master
```

Run the image

```sh
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v /path/to/.env:/usr/src/app/.env -d <your username>/song-master
```

Or use docker-compose

Adjust ```/path/to/.env``` in ```docker-compose.yml``` to the full path of your .env file, then run:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```



## Allowing additional users to login

After you create an app in your Spotify Dashboard, it will be in Development mode status by default. What it means:
> Up to 25 Spotify users can install and use your app. These users must be explicitly added under the section "Users and Access" before they can authenticate with your app. If youâ€™d like to ship your app to a broader audience, let us know by submitting a quota extension request.

For more details you can visit the "Users and Access" page in the [Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).
